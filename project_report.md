# Project Report: Cybersecurity Multi-Agent Advisory System

## 1. Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the Cybersecurity Multi-Agent Advisory System, a sophisticated platform designed to provide expert-level cybersecurity guidance through a conversational AI interface. The system leverages a team of specialized AI agents to handle diverse security queries, from real-time threat analysis to compliance and incident response.

The core objective of this project is to create a reliable, intelligent, and responsive advisory service that can assist cybersecurity professionals by automating information retrieval, providing expert analysis, and offering actionable recommendations.

## 2. System Architecture

The advisory system is built on a modular, multi-agent architecture, ensuring that queries are handled by the most qualified specialist.

### Key Components:

- **Frontend**: A clean, intuitive web interface for user interaction, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Workflow Engine**: Orchestrates the entire process from query analysis to response generation using a state graph (`workflow/graph.py`). It manages the flow of information between different components.
- **Specialized Agents (`agents/`)**:
  - **Incident Responder**: Manages active security incidents.
  - **Prevention Specialist**: Focuses on proactive security measures.
  - **Threat Analyst**: Analyzes threats and vulnerabilities.
  - **Compliance Advisor**: Provides guidance on regulatory standards.
  - **Coordinator**: Synthesizes responses from multiple agents.
- **General Assistant**: A general-purpose conversational agent for non-cybersecurity queries, equipped with robust web search capabilities.
- **Cybersecurity Toolkit (`cybersec_mcp/tools/`)**: A suite of powerful tools available to the agents, including:
  - `web_search`: For real-time information retrieval.
  - `vulnerability_search`: For querying CVE databases.
  - `knowledge_search`: For accessing an internal knowledge base.

## 3. Core Features

- **Multi-Agent Collaboration**: The system can dynamically route queries to one or more specialized agents based on the user's needs, providing comprehensive and multi-faceted advice.
- **Intelligent Tool Usage**: Agents are equipped with a toolkit that allows them to perform actions like searching the web, looking up vulnerabilities, and querying a knowledge base.
- **Real-time Web Search**: The system can access up-to-date information from the web to answer questions about current events, weather, time, and breaking news.
- **Context-Aware Conversations**: The system maintains conversational context, allowing for follow-up questions and more natural interactions.
- **Quality Assurance**: A built-in quality gate evaluates the relevance and accuracy of responses before they are sent to the user.

## 4. Recent Changes & Fixes (August 2025)

Over the last day, we have implemented several critical fixes and enhancements to improve the reliability and consistency of the web search functionality.

### Key Improvements:

1.  **Consistent Result Count**: We identified and fixed an issue where the system was requesting an inconsistent number of search results. We have now enforced a standard of **5 results** for every web search across both the general assistant and all specialized agents.
2.  **Optimized Search Depth**: To improve the quality and quantity of search results, the `search_depth` parameter for the web search tool has been changed from `"basic"` to `"advanced"`.
3.  **Selective Query Enhancement**: We disabled the LLM-based query enhancement for time-sensitive searches (like weather and financial data) to prevent the removal of critical keywords and improve accuracy. For now, this feature remains **disabled** for all queries to allow for further testing.
4.  **Improved Result Formatting**: The system now formats all 5 search results in a clean, LLM-friendly format, ensuring that all retrieved information is effectively used to generate a response.
5.  **Enhanced Logging**: We have added detailed, structured logging to the web search tool to make future debugging faster and more effective.

## 5. Testing

A comprehensive testing script has been created in `test_scenarios.md` to validate all aspects of the system's functionality. This script covers:

- Web search queries (time, weather, news).
- Cybersecurity queries for each specialized agent.
- Multi-agent collaboration scenarios.
- Edge cases and error handling.

This test suite is crucial for ensuring the recent fixes have resolved the identified issues and for maintaining a high standard of quality moving forward.

## 6. Future Work

- **Re-evaluate Query Enhancement**: After thorough testing with the enhancement disabled, we can make an informed decision on whether to re-enable it, perhaps with more sophisticated rules.
- **Expand the Toolkit**: Adding more specialized tools (e.g., for static/dynamic code analysis or network scanning) could further enhance the agents' capabilities.
- **Improve Knowledge Base**: Continuously updating the internal knowledge base will ensure the information provided is always current and relevant.

This report confirms that the system is now more robust and reliable, particularly in its ability to access and utilize real-time information from the web.
